            <p>
                Athleticism is a blend of both skill and talent.<br>
                 Some elements, like speed and agility, may be innate to an individual, qualifying as talent.<br>
                 However, skills such as endurance, coordination, and strength often require deliberate training and practice to develop and improve.
